    <p>This is a variation on checkers. It was introduced to me as a thought experiment by a friend. While he is not the only person to have made this thought experiment, I have not found a version of the game available.</p>
    <p>Take a normal checkerboard and glue two oppisite ends together. You should get a cylinder. If you glue the two ends of the cylinder together you get a torus, a dougnut shape. The play of the game is basically the same, except that the edges of the board don't matter. If you cannot visualize it yet, that's alright. On your turn you can select a piece and you'll see the places it can move to.</p>
    <p>Unlike normal checkers you do not have to capture an available piece if you do not wish to. However, once you make a capture with your piece, you must make all subsequent captures with that piece.</p>
